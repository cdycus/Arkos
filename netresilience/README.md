The current implementation of the circuit breaker is genericâ€”it wraps any inter-service call (e.g., HTTP requests to belief, memory, foresight microservices). It's not specifically tied to pulse execution itself, but it can be integrated into pulse logic to protect it from:

Repeated failures during foresight/memory/belief sync.

Cascading outages when one module repeatedly blocks or times out.

Pulse freeze due to downstream API slowness or unavailability.
