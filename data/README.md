🌐 1. EXTERNAL DATA STREAMS
Skippy’s “eyes and ears” in the digital world
Examples:
    • PubMed articles (PDF/JSON)
    • Web search results
    • GitHub repos
    • User prompts or files
    • Sensor data (if connected)
    • Observability logs
    • Third-party APIs
Input Types:
    • Structured (CSV, JSON)
    • Semi-structured (HTML, Markdown)
    • Unstructured (PDFs, web text, raw logs)

🧠 3. HOW THIS DATA INTERACTS WITH SKIPPY'S LAYERS

📚 Memory Layer
    • External data is:
        ◦ Stored as read-only memory with provenance
        ◦ Given tags (source, domain, reliability)
        ◦ Used in similarity recall for future thoughts
“I’ve seen a PubMed paper on this topic before…”

🧠 Mind Layer (Thoughts)
    • Triggers new thoughts:
        ◦ “Is this data aligned with my current belief?”
        ◦ “Do I need to re-evaluate an intent?”
    • Can spawn thought chains:
        ◦ One article leads to 3 follow-up questions → recursive thinking

🌌 Cognitive Foundation
    • Beliefs may be challenged or reinforced:
        ◦ Skippy reads: “New study contradicts X…”
        ◦ Triggers belief_review(belief_id)
    • Emotional reactions possible:
        ◦ PubMed shows systemic bias → triggers cautionary flag

🧬 Decision Layer
    • External data influences:
        ◦ Future scenarios in simulator.py
        ◦ Tradeoffs in qcca.py
        ◦ Intent reshaping
“This new research shifts how I evaluate this plan…”

🧭 Meta Layer
    • Meta logs:
        ◦ What was ingested
        ◦ How it affected Skippy’s thoughts, beliefs, or behavior
    • Meta may trigger audits:
        ◦ “You are acting on unverified web content—do you consent?”
    • Can suppress malicious or low-integrity input

🌌 Quantum Layer
    • External data becomes part of the field of possibility
        ◦ New futures are simulated based on latest knowledge
        ◦ Coherence/resonance scores updated
        ◦ “What future does this research now make possible?”

🔒 ACCESS POLICIES
All external inputs must:
    • Be traceable
    • Be taggable by domain, source, and confidence
    • Be non-authoritative unless validated by Meta
    • Never overwrite memory—only extend it
