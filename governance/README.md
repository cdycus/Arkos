# Governance Layer

This module governs Skippy's foresight and decision logic. It includes:

- `audit_engine.py` — checks foresight results for confidence thresholds
- `policy_enforcer.py` — applies written rules to intents
- `escalation_log.py` — logs all overrides or policy violations

Policy file: `policy_rules.json` defines intent-level blocking rules.

## Models Added
- ConfidenceAnomalyDetector: flags low-confidence foresights


🛡️ Governance Stack v1 will give Skippy its first true policy enforcement and reflexive correction layer — the mechanism by which it enforces internal laws and corrects cognitive drift.

🧠 Governance Stack v1 — Core Mission

“I caught something wrong. Do I escalate? Suppress? Amend? Just log it?”

🧩 What Skippy Needs in Governance v1
| Feature                   | Role                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧾 **Policy enforcement** | Compare decisions/pulses to defined policies       |
