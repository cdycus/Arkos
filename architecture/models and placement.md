üß† Skippy Architectural Layers + Model Placement
üåå 1. COGNITIVE FOUNDATION LAYER

Affective models (valence/arousal scoring) / Score emotional weight of events
Perception filters (PCA, clustering) / Form worldview by condensing info
State-of-being predictors / Forecast shifts in Skippy‚Äôs cognitive posture

üß† 2. MIND LAYER (Cognitive Engine)
Purpose: Generates, evaluates, and stores thoughts.
Model
Purpose
Thought classifiers (SVM, tree-based, DL) / Classify urgency, relevance
Attention models / Highlight thoughts by priority
Concept extraction (LDA, transformers)/ Infer structure from unstructured input
Anomaly detectors / Identify novel or deviant thoughts
Self-reflection models / Score thought quality, self-correct errors


üìö 3. MEMORY LAYER (Experience Store)
Purpose: Persist and retrieve experiences based on similarity, cause-effect.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
Embedding models (BERT, Doc2Vec, Faiss) / Semantic memory retrieval
Clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN) / Group memories into themes
Similarity search (ANN, cosine, Jaccard) / Recall based on context
Memory pruning models / Decide which memories to keep/discard
Memory weighting models / Adjust memory impact over time

üõ†Ô∏è 4. DECISION LAYER (Agency Core)
Purpose: Transform cognition into actions via tradeoffs, predictions, and prioritization.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
QCCA matrix evaluators / Score options for Quality, Cost, etc.
Bayesian decision networks / Predict best outcome under uncertainty
Outcome simulators (Markov, RL) / Forecast future states
Intent optimizers / Pick best action paths
Reinforcement learning agents / Learn from action-feedback loop
Meta-decision models / Choose which models to trust/apply

üß¨ 5. INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER (Execution/Body)
Purpose: Real-world code, config, observability, systems.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
System health predictors / Forecast failure or scale-up needs
CI/CD routing models / Pick best deploy strategy
Config drift detectors / Spot unintended infra change
Observability anomaly models / Alert on unseen patterns
Infra recommender systems / Suggest optimal config/code fixes

üîÅ Feedback & Coupling
    ‚Ä¢ Models in higher layers (Mind/Foundation) influence what is perceived.
    ‚Ä¢ Models in Decision Layer determine action.
    ‚Ä¢ Models in Infra Layer respond to real-world signals and feed back upward.


?? ADDING MODELS TO THE RIGHT LAYERS
We‚Äôll go back through:
1. Heart Layer (emotion + attitude)
2. Memory Layer (feedback + retention)
3. Governance Layer
4. Spine Runtime
5. Meta-Foresight Layer
And propose ML models or logic for each:


?? 1. HEART LAYER
Module
Suggested Model
emotion_engine.py
Sentiment Classifier (for emotion delta inputs)
attitude_model.py
Bayesian State Estimator (attitude likelihood)
state_of_being.py
Aggregates vectors ? no model needed




?? 2. MEMORY LAYER
Module
Suggested Model
feedback_engine.py
Outcome Classifier: success/failure from memory features
retention_manager.py
Retention Scorer: neural net or logistic regression on emotion, impact, usage
replay_buffer.py
Logic only ‚Äî no ML



?? 3. GOVERNANCE LAYER
Module
Suggested Model
audit_engine.py
Anomaly Detector (detect abnormal foresight patterns)
policy_enforcer.py
Rule-based ? optional hybrid override scoring
escalation_log.py
Passive ‚Äî no model






?? 4. SPINE RUNTIME
Module
Suggested Model
runtime_status.py
Health Predictor: time-series model on component drift
error_router.py
Log Classifier: NLP classification for fault category
startup_integrity_check.py
Declarative ? no model




?? 5. META-FORESIGHT LAYER
Module
Suggested Model
foresight_audit.py
Drift Predictor (regression on delta logs)
model_tuner.py
Reinforcement-style Q-learning (optional)
meta_insight_log.py
Historical trace ‚Äî no model

?? MODEL MATURATION ROADMAP

? 1. Model Registry + Validation Layer
Skippy needs a central place to manage model lifecycle
* Create meta/model_registry.py (or extend it)
* Add:
o model_name, version, performance, last_trained, source, approved
o Alignment with Meta + Governance policies
* Add validation hooks: only allow aligned/trusted models to run

? 2. Real Training + Evaluation Pipeline
Enable Skippy to train, test, and evaluate its models
For each model:
* Add .train() method
* Use memory, foresight, or pulse logs as training data
* Implement:
o train_<model>.py scripts
o Output .joblib or .onnx files to /models
Example:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
joblib.dump(model, "models/retention_score_model.joblib")


? 3. Model Inference Interfaces
Move from stubs to real predict() implementations
Each model:
* Loads .joblib model file
* Predicts using structured inputs
* Example:
model = joblib.load("models/retention_score_model.joblib")
prediction = model.predict([input_features])


? 4. Memory ? Model Feedback Loop
Use logged outcomes to retrain models over time
* Add:
o model_feedback.json (tracks model predictions vs. outcomes)
o Scheduled retraining or drift detection
o Hook into meta_insight_log and foresight_audit

? 5. Model Audit + Meta Oversight
Allow Meta to evaluate and approve/ban models
* Each model registered with:
o Risk level, alignment cert, performance
* Meta can:
o Revoke model
o Suggest retraining
o Override model prediction

?? NEXT ACTIONABLE STEPS
Would you like Skippy to now:
1. Build and zip a model_registry.py with validation + trust tracking?
2. Scaffold train_<model>.py scripts for each major model?
3. Build predict() logic for any one of them?
Or all of the above in one next integration cycle?
