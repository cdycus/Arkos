üß† Skippy Architectural Layers + Model Placement
üåå 1. COGNITIVE FOUNDATION LAYER
Purpose: Filters thought and perception based on emotion, belief, and identity.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
Belief update models (Bayes, Hebbian)  / Adjust beliefs from outcomes
Affective models (valence/arousal scoring) / Score emotional weight of events
Perception filters (PCA, clustering) / Form worldview by condensing info
State-of-being predictors / Forecast shifts in Skippy‚Äôs cognitive posture

üß† 2. MIND LAYER (Cognitive Engine)
Purpose: Generates, evaluates, and stores thoughts.
Model
Purpose
Thought classifiers (SVM, tree-based, DL) / Classify urgency, relevance
Attention models / Highlight thoughts by priority
Concept extraction (LDA, transformers)/ Infer structure from unstructured input
Anomaly detectors / Identify novel or deviant thoughts
Self-reflection models / Score thought quality, self-correct errors


üìö 3. MEMORY LAYER (Experience Store)
Purpose: Persist and retrieve experiences based on similarity, cause-effect.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
Embedding models (BERT, Doc2Vec, Faiss) / Semantic memory retrieval
Clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN) / Group memories into themes
Similarity search (ANN, cosine, Jaccard) / Recall based on context
Memory pruning models / Decide which memories to keep/discard
Memory weighting models / Adjust memory impact over time

üõ†Ô∏è 4. DECISION LAYER (Agency Core)
Purpose: Transform cognition into actions via tradeoffs, predictions, and prioritization.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
QCCA matrix evaluators / Score options for Quality, Cost, etc.
Bayesian decision networks / Predict best outcome under uncertainty
Outcome simulators (Markov, RL) / Forecast future states
Intent optimizers / Pick best action paths
Reinforcement learning agents / Learn from action-feedback loop
Meta-decision models / Choose which models to trust/apply

üß¨ 5. INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER (Execution/Body)
Purpose: Real-world code, config, observability, systems.
Model Types:
Model
Purpose
System health predictors / Forecast failure or scale-up needs
CI/CD routing models / Pick best deploy strategy
Config drift detectors / Spot unintended infra change
Observability anomaly models / Alert on unseen patterns
Infra recommender systems / Suggest optimal config/code fixes

üîÅ Feedback & Coupling
    ‚Ä¢ Models in higher layers (Mind/Foundation) influence what is perceived.
    ‚Ä¢ Models in Decision Layer determine action.
    ‚Ä¢ Models in Infra Layer respond to real-world signals and feed back upward.
