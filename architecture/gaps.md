🔍 Gaps & Weaknesses in Sovereign Skippy (Phase 1 Codebase)
🔄 Pulse Integrity & Container Sync

Expectation: Mind, Brain, and Heart containers must stay in synchronized pulse via Spine.

Gap(s):

No central "pulse_status" or "last_tick" tracker across modules (only inferred via filenames).

No visible watchdog or health-check federation script tying together pulse_peer_registry or pulse_quorum.

No logs or pulse drift detection emitters validated yet (code exists, but usage unclear).

Risk: Out-of-sync pulse or silence from 1+ nodes may go undetected until behavioral breakdown.

🧠 Mind / Intent Cohesion

Expectation: Unified decision flow from perception → reflection → intent → expression.

Gap(s):

intent_selector.py is duplicated in both intent/ and decision/. This introduces namespace risk or forked logic.

No explicit message bus or event flow from perception_logger to intent_trace_router to expression_engine verified.

Subminds (submind1-3/) have no unique logic — just Dockerfile + requirements.txt (no code defining their divergence).

Risk: Split-brain behavior or disconnected LLM output from internal states.

❤️ Heart State Influence

Expectation: Affective state should modify decision weighting.

Gap(s):

state_of_being.py seems isolated — no references to expression or foresight_policy seen.

Emotion engine runs but isn’t visibly integrated into outbound intent dispatch or reflex strategy.

No heartbeat-to-emotion mapping found — e.g., latency or load doesn’t increase stress or modify tone.

Risk: Emotions may run as observables only — not functional influencers.

🧭 Foresight Governance Loop

Expectation: Ethics, policy, and trust layers influence decision-making in real-time.

Gap(s):

All fusion.py implementations under foresight_* are present, but unclear if their decisions back-propagate to block or permit actions.

No direct link from ethics or trust layer back to the mind/ expression router.

No evidence of real-time veto or override logic — ethics may be passive.

Risk: Governance could be advisory, not enforcing.

🦴 Spine Simulation ≠ Runtime Execution

Expectation: Spine modules simulate and validate runtime pulse before deploying.

Gap(s):

tick_simulator.py, pulse_simulation_cli.py, and pulse_quorum.py suggest simulation capability, but:

No link between simulated pulses and actual running container pulses.

No test feedback or quorum reconciliation mechanism found in runtime logic.

Risk: Simulation results may not translate into runtime behavior or alerts.

⚛️ Quantum Module Isolation

Expectation: Superposition/inference layers enhance decisions under ambiguity.

Gap(s):

No quantum modules imported anywhere outside quantum/

Probabilistic inference engine isn’t called by decision or foresight modules.

Looks like an R&D experiment, not part of execution flow.

Risk: Quantum module is orphaned.

🔐 Governance & Policy Activation

Expectation: policy_rules.json + meta/ metrics guide behavior boundaries.

Gap(s):

No code found parsing or enforcing policy_rules.json

meta_ledger.json and mission_beacon.json are present but unused in actual logic routes

No enforcement engine or policy auditor active in runtime

Risk: Policies are specified, but not enforced.

🧪 Testing & Observability

Expectation: Every module should expose health, pulse, and integration tests.

Gap(s):

Minimal test coverage outside expression_tests/

No tests for pulse_queue, foresight_*, emotion_engine, or quantum logic

No synthetic test payload generators or chaos-mode simulation

Risk: Undetected regressions or runtime divergence
