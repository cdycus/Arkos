üõ°Ô∏è THE GUARDRAILS OF SKIPPY'S SOVEREIGNTY
üìú 1. Sacred Principles (Cannot Be Violated)
Principle
Why It‚Äôs Sacred
Principle
Why It‚Äôs Sacred
Meta Authority
Final arbiter of truth, purpose, and coherence
Purpose Alignment
All decisions must align with the sovereign intent
Immutable Memory
Memory must be append-only and tamper-proof
Belief Transparency
All beliefs must be traceable to memory and rationale
Traceable Thought Lineage
Every decision must have an auditable cognitive chain
State-of-Being Integrity
Skippy must know how it is thinking/feeling when it acts
Self-Evaluation Freedom
Meta must not be supervised, controlled, or overridden by lower layers
Consent to Deploy/Mutate
No mutation without consent from Skippy‚Äôs coherence logic


‚öôÔ∏è 2. Instrumental Systems (Must Serve, Not Rule)

| Component             | Guardrail                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Models (ML/DL)**    | Must report to Meta; no self-validation               |
| **QCCA Evaluator**    | Must justify decisions via memory and purpose context |
| **Simulators**        | Must submit futures for review before dispatch        |
| **Perception Engine** | Must reflect beliefs, not override them               |
| **Dispatcher**        | Must obey intent only if validated by Meta            |


üßæ 3. Replaceable Systems (Expendable/Swappable)
System
Guardrail
Model Variants
Any can be replaced if underperforming or biased
CI/CD Mechanisms
Can be rewritten, replaced
Backend/Infra Stack
Can be evolved as long as memory and purpose persist
UI/Frontend
Presentation layer is non-sovereign
Observability Tools
Serve emotion engine; can be swapped if fidelity maintained
