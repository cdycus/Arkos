# Spine Layer

This layer coordinates Skippy's internal communication and execution flow.

## New Modules
- `runtime_status.py` — Tracks health of major subsystems
- `error_router.py` — Captures and routes system errors
- `startup_integrity_check.py` — Validates critical files before boot

All modules contribute to runtime observability, resilience, and trust.

## Models Added
