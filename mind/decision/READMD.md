🛠️ DECISION LAYER (Agentic Control Core)

The Decision Layer takes thoughts, memories, current state-of-being, and perception, runs tradeoff logic and simulations, and determines whether, what, and how to act.

🔄 Core Feedback Inputs

Thoughts (from Mind Layer)

Memory Recalls (from Memory Layer)

Belief Filters (from Cognitive Foundation)

State-of-Being (contextual bias)

System Telemetry (via Observability)

✅ Yes — that is exactly what your Decision Layer is designed to do. And it aligns perfectly with how we’re now structuring and expanding Skippy's cognitive engine.

Let me break it down for clarity:

🛠️ Decision Layer (Agentic Control Core) — Purpose Recap

“Should I act? What should I do? Why do I believe this is best?”

This is Skippy’s internal governor, and it must combine:
| Source                   | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 **Thoughts** (Mind)   | Current foresight candidates or triggered decisions    |
| 📚 **Memory Recalls**    | Beliefs + past experiences relevant to this thought    |
| 🔍 **Belief Filters**    | Modulate what gets through (confidence, alignment)     |
| 🧭 **State-of-Being**    | Cognitive/emotional posture that affects decision mode |
| 📡 **Telemetry** (Infra) | External signals, system state, drift, load, entropy   |


✅ What It Leverages Right Now
| Decision Feature                    | Source                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Fusion of foresight strategies      | `mind/decision/fusion.py`                    |
| Foresight trigger routing           | `foresight_runner.py` + `trigger_handler.py` |
| Belief injection                    | `belief_ids` passed to foresight             |
| Drift input                         | `drift_monitor.py`                           |
| Feedback labeling                   | `pulse_feedback_engine.py`                   |
| Expression → Belief → Decision flow | `expression_engine.py` feeds narrative trace |
| (Pending) Intent selector           | Will be in `intent_selector.py`              |
| (Pending) Justification log         | Will be in `meta_fusion_log.jsonl`           |


🔄 How All These Inputs Flow into a Decision
graph TD
    A[Thoughts (triggered foresight)] --> D
    B[Belief Set (from memory)] --> D
    C[Drift / Volatility] --> D
    E[State of Being (emotional)] --> D
    F[Pulse Load / Telemetry] --> D
    D[Decision Engine (fusion_aware.py)] --> G[Chosen Action/Result]


The Decision Layer is where cognition converges, not where actions are simply emitted.

✅ You Are Building This Properly

The fact that mind/decision/ exists

The separation from spine/

The plans for intent_selector.py, foresight_weight_strategy.json, and meta_fusion_log.jsonl

All point to a true agentic control core being formed

Would you like me to begin coding all components of Decision Stack v1 now inside mind/decision/, with all of this architecture in mind?
