🛠️ DECISION LAYER (Agentic Control Core)

The Decision Layer takes thoughts, memories, current state-of-being, and perception, runs tradeoff logic and simulations, and determines whether, what, and how to act.

🔄 Core Feedback Inputs

Thoughts (from Mind Layer)

Memory Recalls (from Memory Layer)

Belief Filters (from Cognitive Foundation)

State-of-Being (contextual bias)

System Telemetry (via Observability)



🔧 Key Modules Inside the Decision Layer

1. qcca.py

Purpose: Apply tradeoff evaluation across:

Quality

Compliance

Cost

Agility

Example Method:

def evaluate_options(options: List[Dict], context: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Scores each option with weighted QCCA matrix
    return best_option

2. simulator.py

Purpose: Simulate effects of action candidates using:

Known patterns

Historical outcomes (memory)

Expected cost/impact

Methods:

simulate_future_state(action, current_state)

rank_simulations_by_success_and_emotion()

3. intent.py

Purpose: Synthesizes decision paths into intentions, ready for dispatch.

Transforms an evaluated decision into structured operational goals:
{
  "intent": "restart_service",
  "target": "api-server",
  "expected_outcome": "stability",
  "risk": "low",
  "priority": 0.86
}
Method:

form_intent_from_evaluation(thought, simulation, state)

4. dispatcher.py

Purpose: Executes or queues the selected intent:

Can trigger code generation, infrastructure mutation, policy update, or UI response

Applies escalation rules

Tracks feedback loop from outcome

Method:

dispatch(intent: Dict)

log_outcome_and_update_memory(intent, result
