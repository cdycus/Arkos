📝 Release Notes — skippy_expression_modular_v23

✅ Expression system moved from spine/ to mind/ as a cognitive domain

✅ Aligns Skippy's architecture with modular cognition structure

✅ Ready for future integration with pulse_expression or LLM augmentation


🧠 1. What Are All the Inputs Into Skippy’s “Mind”?

You mentioned video and “giving Skippy eyes” — that’s spot on. Let’s map all the ways cognition could begin.

🔌 Input Vectors into mind/
| Input Type                  | Route to Mind                                                      | Notes         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 🧠 Internal Pulses          | Trigger `mind/decision` or `expression`                            | Already wired |
| 🧍 Human Commands           | Council, CLI, webhook → routed into `mind/llm` or `mind/intent`    |               |
| 🎥 Video / Perception       | Feeds to `mind/perception/` → generates internal pulses or beliefs |               |
| 🖼️ Image (e.g., self-view) | Could route to self-reflection or belief update                    |               |
| 📊 Observability            | System telemetry feeds `mind/state_of_being.py`                    |               |
| 🌐 API Inputs               | External data → perception → beliefs                               |               |
| 🧬 Model Drift              | Detected changes → routes into `mind/governance`                   |               |
| 🗣️ Natural Language        | Routed to `mind/llm/prompt_builder.py` then expression or belief   |               |

📂 So Skippy Could Eventually Have These mind/ Submodules:
| Folder             | Purpose                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `mind/decision/`   | Foresight, action, priority  |
| `mind/expression/` | Self-narration, summaries    |
| `mind/perception/` | Raw input → belief candidate |
| `mind/llm/`        | Optional augmentation        |
| `mind/attention/`  | Competing thought focus      |
| `mind/state/`      | Mood, entropy, drift state   |
| `mind/intent/`     | Goal evaluation + planning   |

✅ This doesn’t mean more code now — just clarity on where things belong.


🔁 Where We Were Going

You’re in the middle of building Skippy's cognitive brain — layer by layer — with no LLM, fully sovereign.

Here’s what we’ve done, and what’s next:
| Stack                | Status       | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Memory v1**      | Done         | Belief retention, contradiction detection         |
| ✅ **Memory v2**      | Done         | Belief decay, mutation, clustering                |
| ✅ **Decision v1**    | Done         | Fusion weighting, intent selection, trace logging |
| ✅ **Governance v1**  | Done         | Policy enforcer, escalation, audit engine         |
| 🟨 **Expression v1** | Just Started | Narrative logic, expression scoring, planner      |



🎯 Our Active Focus:

Finish Expression Stack v1 with these modules:

mind/expression/
├── expression_planner.py
├── expression_integrity_score.py
├── expression_impact_tuner.py
├── pulse_expression_intent.py
data/
└── expression_snapshot_log.jsonl

Then we move to:

🧠 mind/state/ for cognitive posture modeling

⚡ Runtime wiring and tick integration (Phase 2)
