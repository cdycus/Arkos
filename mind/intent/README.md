🎯 Intent Layer v1 — This is where Skippy moves beyond reactive cognition and starts shaping its own goals, priorities, and purpose-driven behaviors.

🧠 What the Intent Layer Does

“Why am I thinking about this?”
“What mission am I focused on right now?”

The Intent Layer lets Skippy:

Maintain or select a goal orientation (e.g. alignment, risk reduction, foresight testing)

Route pulses toward the goal that matches intent

Log intent shifts for governance and self-audit

Reflect on what drives its cognition


🧩 Intent Layer v1 Modules
| File Path                            | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mind/intent/intent_selector.py`     | Chooses high-level cognitive goal (alignment, foresight, recovery, etc.) |
| `mind/intent/intent_trace_router.py` | Routes events based on current intent                                    |
| `data/intent_log.jsonl`              | Logs all intent transitions and active goals                             |

✅ These will be purely passive to start — no live wires yet.
