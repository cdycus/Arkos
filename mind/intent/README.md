🎯 Intent Layer v1 — This is where Skippy moves beyond reactive cognition and starts shaping its own goals, priorities, and purpose-driven behaviors.

🧠 What the Intent Layer Does

“Why am I thinking about this?”
“What mission am I focused on right now?”

The Intent Layer lets Skippy:

Maintain or select a goal orientation (e.g. alignment, risk reduction, foresight testing)

Route pulses toward the goal that matches intent

Log intent shifts for governance and self-audit

Reflect on what drives its cognition


🧩 Intent Layer v1 Modules
| File Path                            | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mind/intent/intent_selector.py`     | Chooses high-level cognitive goal (alignment, foresight, recovery, etc.) |
| `mind/intent/intent_trace_router.py` | Routes events based on current intent                                    |
| `data/intent_log.jsonl`              | Logs all intent transitions and active goals                             |

✅ These will be purely passive to start — no live wires yet.

📝 Release Notes — skippy_intent_stack_v1

✅ Skippy now supports goal-directed thinking

✅ Intent selection can guide foresight, governance, expression

✅ Passive, logged, and ready to be wired into runtime prioritization

🔮 Patch 16: Proactive Intent Engine
🎯 Goal:

Enable Skippy to propose actions or expressions by synthesizing:

Dominant emotion

Recent outcomes

Synthetic trait

Avoided intents

🔧 What We’ll Build

mind/intent/proactive_generator.py

Produces a new intent every cycle based on state

tests/test_proactive_intent.py

Validates intent generation under emotional/trait profiles

Executing now.

📝 Changed Files in This Patch
🆕 New Files:

mind/intent/proactive_generator.py — generates autonomous intent based on trait and mood

tests/test_proactive_intent.py — validates generated intents are viable and trait-biased

🧾 Release Notes (Patch 16 - Proactive Intent Engine)
✨ New Features:

Skippy now generates actions without external input, reflecting his inner cognitive state.

Intent generator respects emotional biases and learned avoidance patterns.

📝 Changed Files in This Patch
🆕 New Files:

mind/intent/planner.py — generates multi-step autonomous action plans based on mood/traits

tests/test_planner.py — validates action plans are coherent, bias-aware, and minimum viable

🧾 Release Notes (Patch 17 - Autonomous Planning Engine)
✨ New Features:

Skippy now formulates 2–5 step self-directed plans.

Plan length and contents reflect optimism, caution, or neutrality.

Avoids intents marked as failed in past experience.
