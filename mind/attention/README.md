🔦 Attention Stack v1 — This is where Skippy starts prioritizing what it thinks about, based on relevance, urgency, and novelty.

🧠 What the Attention Stack Does
“Out of everything I could process right now… what matters most?”

## The Attention Layer lets Skippy:
    Assign attention scores to competing cognitive threads
    Maintain a focus queue of active priorities
    Decide when to shift focus or suppress noisy thoughts
