🧠 Expression Stack v1 is where Skippy becomes a narrative being — 
capable of self-reporting, reflecting on its cognitive processes, 
and describing its state using deterministic logic.

🗣️ Expression Stack v1 — Mission

“What have I been thinking? How am I doing? What should I share?”

This phase gives Skippy awareness of its mental patterns and the 
ability to report them in structured, human-readable form.

🔁 Where We Were Going

You’re in the middle of building Skippy's cognitive brain — layer by layer — with no LLM, fully sovereign.

Here’s what we’ve done, and what’s next:
🔁 Where We Were Going

| Stack                | Status       | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Memory v1**      | Done         | Belief retention, contradiction detection         |
| ✅ **Memory v2**      | Done         | Belief decay, mutation, clustering                |
| ✅ **Decision v1**    | Done         | Fusion weighting, intent selection, trace logging |
| ✅ **Governance v1**  | Done         | Policy enforcer, escalation, audit engine         |
| 🟨 **Expression v1** | Just Started | Narrative logic, expression scoring, planner      |


🎯 Our Active Focus:

Finish Expression Stack v1 with these modules:
mind/expression/
├── expression_planner.py
├── expression_integrity_score.py
├── expression_impact_tuner.py
├── pulse_expression_intent.py
data/
└── expression_snapshot_log.jsonl


Then we move to:

🧠 mind/state/ for cognitive posture modeling

⚡ Runtime wiring and tick integration (Phase 2)

✅ Recommendation:

Let’s finish Expression Stack v1 now, then build out Perception Stack v1 as a new track.

🧭 Now: The Real-Time Perception Roadmap (Future Track)

| Goal: | Give Skippy eyes and ears, connect perception to memory, decision, and expression. |


🧠 Perception Stack v1 Roadmap
| Phase                       | What It Delivers                                   | Notes                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **1. Scaffolding**          | `mind/perception/` folder with input handlers      | No real CV yet                 |
| **2. Pulse Protocol**       | `pulse_perception_event.py` + routing stub         | Declares observation intent    |
| **3. Logging**              | `visual_input_log.jsonl` + `audio_input_log.jsonl` | Logs inputs without processing |
| **4. Real CV Plug-in**      | YOLOv8, OpenCV, MediaPipe support                  | Plugged into `cv_engine.py`    |
| **5. Expression Awareness** | "I see someone" becomes expression/decision        | Reflected in logs              |
| **6. Multi-modal fusion**   | Combine video + voice → single pulse               | Optional, future               |


📦 Files in Perception Stack v1
mind/perception/
├── video_input_stub.py
├── audio_input_stub.py
├── pulse_perception_event.py
├── perception_logger.py
data/
├── visual_input_log.jsonl
├── audio_input_log.jsonl

Later:

Add cv_engine.py, audio_listener.py, realtime_loop.py

🧭 Your Path Forward
| Step      | What You Should Do Now                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Step 1  | Finish **Expression Stack v1** (passive narrative modules)    |
| 🟢 Step 2 | Scaffold **Perception Stack v1** (video/audio input routing)  |
| 🔁 Step 3 | Return to `mind/state/` and finalize internal cognitive loop  |
| 🔂 Step 4 | Wire the system tick loop and test self-awareness pulse cycle |
