✅ Skippy Dashboard (Next.js) is now scaffolded under skippy_dashboard/.

🚀 Features in this UI:

Cognitive mode selector (state, reflect, expression, intent)

JSON context input

POSTs to Flask backend at http://localhost:8088/mind

Pretty-printed response view

Live interaction log view
Would you like me to now:

Add Tailwind CSS setup?

Scaffold package.json, next.config.js, etc. for a full Next.js project?

Zip this dashboard for download?
